<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Portal 2 draws from the award-winning formula of innovative gameplay, story, and music that earned the original Portal over 70 industry accolades and created a cult following.<br/><br/>										The single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game.<br/> <br/>										The game’s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively.<br/> <br/> <strong>Product Features</strong><br/> <ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Extensive single player:</strong> Featuring next generation gameplay and a wildly-engrossing story.<br/> </li><li><strong>Complete two-person co-op:</strong> Multiplayer game featuring its own dedicated story, characters, and gameplay.<br/> </li><li><strong>Advanced physics:</strong> Allows for the creation of a whole new range of interesting challenges, producing a much larger but not harder game.<br/> </li><li><strong>Original music.</strong><br/> </li><li><strong>Massive sequel:</strong> The original Portal was named 2007's Game of the Year by over 30 publications worldwide. <br/> </li><li><strong>Editing Tools:</strong> Portal 2 editing tools will be included.<br/> </li></ul> </div>"

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! <br/><br/> <img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/413150/extras/animalStrip2.png?t=1608624324""><br/><br/>You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!<br/><br/><strong>Features </strong><br/><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm!  </strong> Raise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to create the farm of your dreams. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>4 Player Farming!</strong> Invite 1-3 players to join you in the valley online! Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and improve the local community.  As more hands are better than one, players have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more challenging experience.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Improve your skills over time. </strong> As you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Become part of the local community. </strong> With over 30 unique characters living in Stardew Valley, you won't have a problem finding new friends! Each person has their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new things to say throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them, they will open up to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles, or tell you their secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and feast of the winter star. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Explore a vast, mysterious cave. </strong> As you travel deeper underground, you'll encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments, valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and mysteries to be uncovered. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Breathe new life into the valley.</strong> Since JojaMart opened, the old way of life in Stardew Valley has changed. Much of the town's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Help restore Stardew Valley to it's former glory by repairing the old community center, or take the alternate route and join forces with Joja Corporation.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with. </strong> There are 12 available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique character progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on the farm with you. Who knows, maybe you'll have kids and start a family?<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Spend a relaxing afternoon at one of the local fishing spots. </strong> The waters are teeming with seasonal varieties of delicious fish. Craft bait, bobbers, and crab pots to help you in your journey toward catching every fish and becoming a local legend! <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Donate artifacts and minerals to the local museum. </strong><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Cook delicious meals and craft useful items to help you out.  </strong>With over 100 cooking and crafting recipes, you'll have a wide variety of items to create. Some dishes you cook will even give you temporary boosts to skills, running speed, or combat prowess. Craft useful objects like scarecrows, oil makers, furnaces, or even the rare and expensive crystalarium. <br/><br/></li><li><strong>Customize the appearance of your character and house. </strong> With hundreds of decorative items to choose from, you'll have no trouble creating the home of your dreams!<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Xbox controller support (with rumble)! (Keyboard still required for text input) </strong><br/><br/></li><li><strong>Over two hours of original music. </strong></li></ul> </img></div>"

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named ""Best PC Game Ever"" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.<br/><br/>
		NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.<br/><br/>
		The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.<br/><br/>
		The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li><span class=""copyHead"">Characters:</span> Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ""muscles,"" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.</li>
<li><span class=""copyHead"">Physics:</span> From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.</li>
<li><span class=""copyHead"">Graphics:</span> Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.</li>
<li><span class=""copyHead"">AI:</span> Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.</li>

You'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.<br/>                    Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you'll fight through and the pathways you'll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							""When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.""<br/><br/>A tribute to the highly acclaimed film series in which the above quote originated from, No More Room in Hell (PC Gamer's Mod of the Year 2011, ModDB's Editor Choice Multiplayer Mod of the Year 2011), is a co-operative realistic first person survival horror modification for the Source Engine. Taking inspiration from George Romero's ""Of the Dead"" series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill.<br/><br/>The chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Features:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Co-operative play with up to eight players.<br/></li><li><strong>Voice and Text Communications Limited by Distance:</strong> The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close!<br/></li><li><strong>Dynamic Objective Maps:</strong> The next playthrough may not be the same as the last!<br/></li><li><strong>Survival Mode:</strong> Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area.<br/></li><li><strong>A Realistic Approach:</strong> In short, no crosshairs with limited ""only when you want it"" HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head!<br/></li><li><strong>Multitude of Different Opponents:</strong> Ranging from the iconic ""walking zombie"" to the more contemporary ""runners"", NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead...<br/></li><li><strong>Infection:</strong> One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure...<br/></li><li>30+ weapons and counting, ranging from the diminutive .22 Target Pistol, to the almighty Chainsaw.<br/></li><li>No ads (on official and community official servers, user-hosted servers may vary)<br/></li><li>No pay to win items or microtransactions<br/></li><li>100% Free (unless you buy the soundtrack DLC &lt;3)</li></ul>No More Room in Hell is a Half-Life 2 Zombification. The mod was founded in 2003. It switched hands and a new team took over in 2009. Beta version 1.0 was released on Halloween of 2011.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. <br/><br/>The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands?<br/><br/>Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side.<br/></li><li>CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician ""The Elephant"", and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind.<br/></li><li>PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good.<br/></li><li>Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events.<br/></li><li>Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister.<br/></li><li>More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations.  <br/></li><li>Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine?<br/></li><li>Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience.<br/></li><li>A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.</li></ul> </div>"

							The only aim in Rust is to survive. Everything wants you to die - the island’s wildlife and other inhabitants, the environment, other survivors. Do whatever it takes to last another night.<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252490/extras/Rust_Gif_Opt.gif?t=1645133322""><br/><br/>Rust is in its 8th year and has now had over 300 content updates, with a guaranteed content patch every month. From regular balance fixes and improvements to AI and graphics updates to adding content like new maps, musical instruments, trains and drones, as well as regular seasons and events, there’s always something interesting or dangerous (or both) happening on the island. Updates to the game include:<br/><br/><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Procedurally generated worlds with map editor support<br/></li><li>Host your own servers and with server-side modding support<br/></li><li>Vehicles:  horses, modular cars, hot air balloons, helicopters, trains and more<br/></li><li>Complex electrical systems <br/></li><li>Farming<br/></li><li>New enemies, wildlife and factions<br/></li><li>New monuments and areas to explore<br/></li><li>Gestures and contact system<br/></li><li>Musical instruments<br/></li><li>Large train network<br/></li><li>Huge recent graphics overhaul<br/></li><li>..and more</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">EXPLORE</h2><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252490/extras/explore.jpg?t=1645133322""><br/>You wake naked on a mysterious island armed only with a rock and a torch. You’ll need to brave natural dangers (from heat and cold to thirst and starvation), build a shelter, eat (or be eaten), scavenge materials. Explore the island, its abandoned settlements, mysterious monuments and the factions that occupy them. But, above all, watch out for other survivors...<h2 class=""bb_tag"">BUILD</h2><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252490/extras/build.jpg?t=1645133322""><br/>Design and build bases to defend your territory or control the resources of the island. Research the tech tree, grow farms, command electricity, commandeer vehicles from horses to cars to boats to helicopters. Whatever it takes to get ahead.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">SURVIVE</h2><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/252490/extras/survive.jpg?t=1645133322""><br/>There are no rules in Rust but the ones you make for yourself. Craft tools, armor and weapons to defend yourself. Cooperate with friends and allies and build a town together. Explore the island and what’s happening in it. Trade with other players.

Despite being overrun with syndicates, gangs, and secret societies, White Spire has never descended into chaos for one reason: Momma Eeb. She was respected... she was loved... and unfortunately, she was murdered last week. <br/><br/>Eeb’s death has sent one question rippling through White Spire’s underworld: who is going to run the city?<br/><br/>STRATEGIZE TO WIN: Recruit heroes and upgrade them into more powerful versions of themselves. <br/><br/>MIX AND MATCH: Each hero you recruit can form unique alliances. Stacking your team with allied heroes will unlock powerful bonuses that can crush your rivals. <br/><br/>UNDERLORDS: Choose from four Underlords to lead your crew to victory.

Running late? Start a match on your PC and finish it on your mobile device (and vice versa). Your profile in Dota Underlords is shared across all devices, so no matter what you play on, you're always making progress. <br/><br/>RANKED MATCHMAKING: Everyone starts at the bottom, but by playing against other Underlords you'll climb through the ranks and prove you're worthy to rule White Spire. <br/><br/>TOURNAMENT-READY: Create your own private lobbies and matches, then invite spectators to watch 8 Underlords duke it out. <br/><br/>OFFLINE PLAY: Offering a sophisticated AI with 4 levels of difficulty, offline play is a great place to hone your skills. Pause and resume games at your leisure. <br/><br/>SEASONAL ROTATION: Every season we'll say goodbye to certain Heroes, Items, and Alliances to make room for new additions that will shape the ever-evolving world of Underlords.						</div>"

<img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2-Logo-Hztl.png?t=1643233304""> <br/><br/><strong>PlanetSide 2</strong> is a free-to-play, massively multiplayer online first person shooter (MMOFPS).  <br/><br/>Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail. PlanetSide 2 battles persist and the war never ends, offering constant challenges of individual skill, team grit, and empire-wide coordination. Take up arms and drop into intense infantry, vehicle, and air combat. <br/><br/>Players come together in enormous battles across four massive continents to win control of critical territories, gaining key resources for their empire. With an extensive skill tree and class-based system, players can customize their soldier, weapons, and vehicles to match their playstyle and meet the needs of their squads, outfits, and empires. In the world of PlanetSide 2, every soldier makes a difference.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>THREE WARRING EMPIRES</strong> </h2>Players will choose to align with one of three empires: the militaristic, authoritarian Terran Republic; the rebellious, freedom-fighting New Conglomerate; or the technocratic, alien-influenced Vanu Sovereignty. Each empire has access to empire-specific weapons, attachments, vehicles, abilities, and more.<br/><br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_3_Empires.jpg?t=1643233304""><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>MASSIVE WARFARE</strong> </h2>Battles take place not between dozens of soldiers, but between hundreds. They fight on foot. They pile into vehicles. They take to the skies in devastating aircraft. Each battleground holds valuable resources and strategic positions, and the empire that can conquer and hold these territories will be rewarded with the resources and the means to achieve victory.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>ENORMOUS MAPS</strong> </h2>PlanetSide 2 features four incredible and diverse continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space, every inch of which is hand-crafted and contestable. Whether in open fields, barren desert, in armed and armored bases, or in the skies, victory will rely on knowing your surroundings. <br/><br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_4_massive_continents.jpg?t=1643233304""><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>PERSISTENCE THAT PAYS</strong> </h2>In PlanetSide 2 the war isn’t won by a single base capture. The core gameplay of PlanetSide 2 is about holding crucial territories and controlling resources. Working strategically as a team to secure tactical positions has long-lasting effects that can shift the tide of battle.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>CLASS-BASED COMBAT</strong></h2>Players can build their soldier to match wants and their allies' needs. Six distinct classes provide a wealth of squad options and combat tactics. Grow your soldier over time as you master each combat role, weapon, and vehicle, laterally unlocking hundreds of weapons, attachments, gear, skills, vehicles, and more.<br/><br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_6_Classes.jpg?t=1643233304""><br/><br/><strong>Heavy Assault:</strong> Rush into the battle guns blazing. You are the dedicated foot soldier of Auraxis.<br/><br/><strong>Light Assault:</strong> Go where the Heavies can’t with your short-burst jetpack. Pick a high spot, throw a grenade, and out maneuver your foes!<br/><br/><strong>Combat Medic:</strong> Keep your fellow soldiers alive and in fighting shape. You are the beating heart of any squad. <br/><br/><strong>Infiltrator:</strong> Stay silent. Stay invisible. You are death from the shadows, whether with a knife from behind or a single shot from a sniper's nest. You are the enemy's constant fear. <br/><br/><strong>Engineer: </strong> Deploy crucial equipment. Resupply your allies. Fix the thing, then fix it again. You keep the machines running, the tanks firing, and the war effort moving forward. <br/><br/><strong>MAX:</strong> Step into your Mechanized Assault Exo-Suit (MAX). Cannons for hands, armor for flesh, and a disposition to match, you are a walking mass of nigh unstoppable death.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>OUTFIT TEAMWORK</strong> </h2>Join or form your own Outfit, a like-minded group of soldiers who train together day in and day out. Whether a small rapid response team or a massive clan, Outfits are vital to each empire's strategic organization. <br/><br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2_Teamwork.jpg?t=1643233304""><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>VEHICLES &amp; WEAPONS</strong></h2>Train and equip your solider how you want, with a huge array of weapons and vehicles which can be extensively customized by preference or purpose, using attachments, upgrades, and add-ons earned in the war.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>PLAY FOR FREE</strong> </h2><br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2-Massive-Warfare.jpg?t=1643233304""> </img></img></img></img></img></img></div>"

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/TameTrainBreedRide.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/FoodWaterTemp.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HarvestBuildPaint.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/> By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/PlantFarmGrow.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/Summon.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/Tribes.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/RPG.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/HardcoreMechanics.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/ExploreAndDiscover.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/LargeWorld.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/346110/extras/RobustSteamWorkshop.png?t=1644270935""><br/><br/>You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking.

The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.<br/> <br/>The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.<br/><br/>More information about the game is available at <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.deadbydaylight.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.deadbydaylight.com</a><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2>•	<strong>Survive Together… Or Not</strong> - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish.

Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.<br/><br/>•	<strong>A Feast for Killers</strong> - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities.

<h2>About This Game</h2>
<strong>Deceit</strong> tests your instincts at trust and deception in an action-filled, multiplayer first-person shooter. You wake up in unknown surroundings to the sound of the Game Master’s unfamiliar voice. Surrounded by five others, a third of your group have been infected with the Game Master’s deadly virus and tasked with taking down the other innocent players. Innocents must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected try to pick you off one by one.<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/extras/Wake_Up_noui_610x200.gif?t=1647377170""><br/><br/>When playing as an innocent, you’ll progress through the map and come across items to help you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more information on your teammates and what side they’re likely to be on. <br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/extras/blood_bag_610x200.gif?t=1647377170""><br/><br/>A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work together to gather weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting blood and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. <br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/extras/Fuse_610x200.gif?t=1647377170""><br/><br/>At the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players to transform into their terror form and attack. You’ll need this form to kill innocent players. In terror form you’re faster, stronger, and have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense killing animations you’ll be able to create some frightening but also amusing gameplay!<br/><br/><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466240/extras/Terror_execute_610x200.gif?t=1647377170""><br/><br/>Deceit combines the frenzy of fast paced combat mixed with strategic gameplay, and of course the psychological mind games of determining who you can trust.						</img></img></img></img></div>"

<h2>About This Game</h2>
							Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action.<br/><br/>In No Man's Sky, every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Now including...</h2>Play with all major updates since launch: Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation and the 3.0 update, ORIGINS, Next Generation, Companions, Expeditions, Prisms and Frontiers.<br/><br/><br/>An epic voyage to the centre of a shared universe awaits, allowing you to explore, trade, fight and survive alone or with friends.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Embark on an epic voyage</h2>At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Find your own destiny</h2>Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry.<br/><br/><br/>Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards.<br/><br/>Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before. Upgrade your engines to jump ever farther, and strengthen your suit for survival in toxic environments that would kill the unwary.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Share your journey</h2>The galaxy is a living, breathing place.
